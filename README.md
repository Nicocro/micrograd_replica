# micrograd Walkthrough
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed to accompany my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@nico_X/micrograd-the-spelled-out-intro-to-neural-networks-and-backprop-written-walkthrough-a7a6532ff3a4).

It provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of the Micrograd tutorial video by Andrej Karpathy, breaking down key concepts into an intuitive and digestible format. Link to [video here](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=F56xf2GS3yjmZslF)

## Purpose

I created these notebooks as a way to revisit foundational concepts in neural networks and backpropagation. They aim to simplify the Micrograd tutorial even further by exploring the concepts in an organised way and make it more accessible to learners.

## Feedback
